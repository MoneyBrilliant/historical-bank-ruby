# Changelog

## 0.1.0
- Added basic functionality and documentation.

## 0.1.1
- Added support for FREE and DEVELOPER OpenExchangeRates accounts. Downside when using these accounts is that OER rates are fetched for a single day at a time (as opposed to a whole month for more advanced plans).
- Developers have to specify `oer_account_type` during configuration.
